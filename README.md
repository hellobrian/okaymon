# Okaymon

Okaymon is a web app for pokemon -- a directory that tells you when they evolve and how they evolve. 

## API

This API is based on [pokeapi.co](http://pokeapi.co/), the open-source API by Paul Hallett ([Phalt on GitHub](https://github.com/phalt)). 

### Why not use pokeapi? 

The reason why I created my own API is because I only needed a subset of the data that pokeapi provides. 
I also wanted to re-structure the data and endpoints to create a simpler API I could work with in my own projects. 
For example, I wanted the urls for my API endpoints to be as descriptive as possible, that means including named parameters where it makes sense. 
Therefore, it is very easy to find any pokemon's data.

GET /api/pokemon/charmander will return data for Charmander. 
GET /api/type/fire will return data for all fire type pokemon.
